        <h2>Rise Again</h2>
        <p><strong>By Victor Ian V. Townsend, 7 - Rizal</strong></p>
        <p>
            When the world feels dark and cold,<br>
            And your story's yet to be told,<br>
            Don't give up, don't lose your way,<br>
            There's always light at the break of day.<br><br>
            
            Your heart's so cold, you felt betrayed.<br>
            There was a promise you and her made.<br>
            But you'll rise again, you're not a fool.<br>
            You've just got to keep your cool.<br><br>
            
            Through the storms and winds you'll bend,<br>
            But remember, this is not the end,<br>
            Stand up tall, face the sky.<br>
            Spread your wings and start to fly.<br><br>
            
            Every fall makes you strong,<br>
            Every night leads to a dawn.<br>
            In your heart, the fire will reign.<br>
            So rise again, and break the chain.<br><br>
            
            There are plenty of fish in the deep blue sea,<br>
            They could be better than she would ever be.<br>
            Never give up, stay very strong.<br>
            You'll be better than ever, nothing will go wrong.

        <h2>Feeling Invisible</h2>
        <p><strong>By Victor Ian V. Townsend</strong></p>
        <p>
            I feel like I'm drowning in sadness, stuck in a cycle where no matter how hard I try, I can't escape the emptiness. It's like I'm invisible to everyone around me, just a shadow, an afterthought. I tell myself I don't need anyone, but deep down, I crave connection. I want to be someone's first choice, to feel like I truly matter, but instead, I'm left feeling like I'm on the sidelines of everyone else's life. No one checks up on me, no one really cares whether I'm there or not. It’s like I’m just existing, waiting for something that never comes—never feeling loved, never feeling seen. Maybe in another universe, things would be different, but in this one, I’m just here, feeling alone and forgotten.
