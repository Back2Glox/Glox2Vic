        <h2>Rise Again</h2>
        <p>By Victor Ian V. Townsend - 7 Rizal</p>
        <p>When the world feels dark and cold,<br>
        And your story's yet to be told,<br>
        Don't give up, don't lose your way,<br>
        There's always light at the break of day.</p>

        <p>Your heart's so cold, you felt betrayed.<br>
        There was a promise you and her made.<br>
        But you'll rise again, you're not a fool.<br>
        You've just got to keep your cool.</p>

        <p>Through the storms and winds you'll bend,<br>
        But remember, this is not the end,<br>
        Stand up tall, face the sky.<br>
        Spread your wings and start to fly.</p>

        <p>Every fall makes you strong,<br>
        Every night leads to a dawn.<br>
        In your heart, the fire will reign.<br>
        So rise again, and break the chain.</p>

        <p>There are plenty of fish in the deep blue sea,<br>
        They could be better than she would ever be.<br>
        Never give up, stay very strong.<br>
        You'll be better than ever, nothing will go wrong.</p>
