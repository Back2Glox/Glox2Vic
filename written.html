        <h2>Rise Again</h2>
        <p><strong>Victor Ian V. Townsend</strong><br>7 - Rizal</p>
        <p>
            When the world feels dark and cold,<br>
            And your story's yet to be told,<br>
            Don't give up, don't lose your way,<br>
            There's always light at the break of day.<br><br>
            Your heart's so cold, you felt betrayed.<br>
            There was a promise you and her made.<br>
            But you'll rise again, you're not a fool.<br>
            You've just got to keep your cool.<br><br>
            Through the storms and winds you'll bend,<br>
            But remember, this is not the end,<br>
            Stand up tall, face the sky.<br>
            Spread your wings and start to fly.<br><br>
            Every fall makes you strong,<br>
            Every night leads to a dawn.<br>
            In your heart, the fire will reign.<br>
            So rise again, and break the chain.<br><br>
            There are plenty of fish in the deep blue sea,<br>
            They could be better than she would ever be.<br>
            Never give up, stay very strong.<br>
            You'll be better than ever, nothing will go wrong.
        </p>
