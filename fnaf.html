        <h2>Animatronic Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Each animatronic has unique mechanics that change the way players must interact with them. Understanding their behavior is key to survival:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Freddy:</strong> Moves between the camera and the player's location, becoming more aggressive if the player fails to monitor him.</li>
            <li><strong>Bonnie:</strong> Primarily comes from the left side and can enter the room quickly if the player is not careful.</li>
            <li><strong>Chica:</strong> Approaches from the right and can be deterred by flashing the light.</li>
            <li><strong>Foxy:</strong> Stays in Pirate Cove until the player fails to check on him frequently, at which point he will sprint towards the player.</li>
        </ul>
